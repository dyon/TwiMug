# TwiMug
---
TwiMug is a Python application that posts your last image submission from SmugMug to your Twitter account, shortening the url with a custom YOURLS installation. This allows you to have full control over your images and short urls, rather than using third party solutions (like bit.ly).

### Configuration
---
Configuration is as easy as renaming the **config.cfg.dist** file to **config.cfg** and editing the required options. You will need API keys for the three involved services (SmugMug, Twitter and YOURLS).

### TODO
---
There is some work left to do:
  
* Implement a logging system.
* Allow more customization.
* Implement more API calls to extend the functionality.

Any suggestions are welcome :)
